= Installing Apache =
  # Download from http://httpd.apache.org/download.cgi
  # You want version 2.2.9
  # Follow the installation through accepting defaults
  # Once it is completed in your task tray (next to clock) you should see an icon that looks like a feather with a green play button.  That is to control Apache
  # To verify that the server works correctly open up your web browser and type localhost into the address bar
  # It should say something like "It Works!"
  # By default if you do not have a fire wall people from the outside will be able to access your web server do prevent this do the following
    # Go to Start->Programs->Apache HTTP Server->Configure Apache Server->Edit httpd.conf
    # Find the line "Listen 80"
    # Change it to "Listen localhost:80"
    # The Apache Server needs to be restarted for changes to take effect

= Installing PHP =
  # Download from http://www.php.net/downloads.php
  # Start the installer when it asks you for Web Server Setup choose Apache 2.2.x Module
  # Next it will ask you for the directory of the Apache Configuration files 
    # The directory is C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\Apache2.2\conf\
  # After that it will allow you to choose which extensions to install choose PDO (and under PDO choose the PostgreSQL driver), PostgreSQL, XML-RPC, we may need more extensions later on but for now those should be good.
  # Restart the Apache Server again
  # navigate to C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\Apache2.2\htdocs and create a file called index.php
  # within the file put the following
{{{
<?php phpinfo(); ?>
}}}
  # Now in your web browser go to http://localhost/index.php you should see a page that says PHP Version 5.2.6, that means that everything it working correctly
  

= Installing Postgre SQL =
  # Download it here http://www.postgresql.org/download/
  # Since we don't have any databases or tables you just need to install it

= Installing Eclipse = 
  # Go to http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/
  # Choose Eclipse IDE for Java Developers (84 MB)
  # Run the installer program and verify that you can start it up
