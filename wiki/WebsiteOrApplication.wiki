#summary The pros and cons of having a Website for this versus an Application
#labels Featured

= Website =
Web application developed in PHP
== Pros ==
  # Easy language to learn
  # Fairly simple to make HTML/CSS interfaces that look good and are easy to change
  # Allows users to interact with each other
  # Simple enough to be done in 10 weeks
  # Lots of tools available
    # PHP Unit for unit testing
    # Doctrine - ORM for PHP
== Cons ==
  # Requires setup of Apache/PHP/Database on the developer's machine
  # Need a way for users to 'upload' their collection details to the website
    # Being a website we have no access to the user's hard drive so we cannot scan it from the website.  So we will have to devise a plan to get music information from the user's hard drive up to the website.  We could create a program in Java/Python to do this.  -- We should think about this a lot.

= Application =
Stand alone application developed in Java
== Pros ==
  # If done in Java it is very similar to C/C++ which all of us know
  # Does not require installation of a web server
  # We have less constraints than with web applications
    # Meaning we can access the user's hard drive directly to import music
  # Tons of tools available
    # Famous JUnit for unit testing
    # Hibernate - ORM
    # Eclipse IDE

== Cons ==
  # Java GUI programs are a pain in the but to develop - and even harder to customized compared to doing HTML/CSS
  # User's won't be able to interact with each other
  # Depending on fast we create the GUI it could take longer than 10 weeks
